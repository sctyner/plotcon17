## Outline

- Motivation
- Working Example
- Model
- Visualizations
    * Static
    * Animation
    * Interactivity with `plotly`

## Motivating Example

Childhood vaccination - major public health concern

- [Vaccination animation](https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated)

<img src="img/guardian.png" alt="Screenshot of animation from The Guardian" style="width:600px;">

## Questions

Random interactions in animation aren't realistic

- How do communities affect vaccination rate?
- How do communities affect spread of disease from outside source? 
- What factors lead to unvaccinated children?
- Can communities be identified and targeted for immunization programs?

> Can network modeling answer these? 

## Working Example

Another public health concern - underage drinking & smoking

> How do friendships influence drinking and smoking behavior in teenagers?

Steglich, Snijders & Pearson (2010) "Dynamic Networks and Behavior: Searating Selection from Influence"

## Data

From "Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study" (Pearson & Mitchell (2000); Pearson & West (2003))

- Glasgow, Scotland, UK, Feb 1995 - Jan 1997
- Panel data - three waves - aged 12-13 to 14-15
- Each student lists up to 6 school friends
- Smoking & drinking behavior, other lifestyle variables collected
- 160 students in total, only 50 in [example data](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/)

## Model

- Want: to determine how friendships change risky behavior and vice versa over time
- Solution: stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) for networks (Snijders 1996)
    * Stochastic because they model network change over time
    * Actor-oriented because actor-level covariates are incorporated into model parameters
    
## Underlying Mechanisms?

Network changes

- Change doesn't happen all at once, but network observations are discrete
- Changes are dependent, with a highly complex structure
- How to model process? 
    * Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs)
    * Condition on wave 1
    * Choose one actor (call it $i$) to (potentially) make a change
    * Choose a second actor (call it $j$) to whom actor $i$ changes ties with probability $p_{ij}$
    
## Rate Function

Rate at which actors are selected to act

- Simple rate parameter, $\alpha$, for all actors
- Waiting time for *one* actor to act is distributed $Exp(\alpha^{-1})$
- Waiting time for *any* actor to act is distributed $Exp((n\alpha)^{-1})$
- Probability that actor $i$ will be the next one to act is $\frac{1}{n}$

## Objective Function

When actor $i$ can change, it tries to maximize its objective function:

$$f_i(x, \mathbf{z}, \boldsymbol{\beta}) = \sum_k \beta_k s_{ik}(x, \mathbf{z})$$

- $x$ is the network state
- $\mathbf{z}$ is a matrix of actor-level covariates
- $s_{ik}(x, \mathbf{z})$ are network & covariate statistics
- $\beta_k$ are the parameters to be fit in the model
- There can be any number of $\beta_k$ added to the model (problematic)

## Transition Probability

The probability that actor $i$ will change the tie to actor $j$ is: 

$$p_{ij} = \frac{\exp\left\{f_i(x(i\leadsto j), \mathbf{z}, \boldsymbol{\beta})\right\}}{\sum_h \exp\left\{f_i(x(i\leadsto h), \mathbf{z}, \boldsymbol{\beta})\right\}}$$
- $x(i\leadsto j)$ is the network identical to the current state, $x$, except for $x_{ij}$, which becomes $1-x_{ij}$ 


## (Some) Possible Model Parameters 

Structural Effect | Sufficient Statistic | Interpretation
------------------|----------------------|----------------
outdegree*        | $s_{i1}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}$ | Popularity
reciprocity*       | $s_{i2}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}x_{ji}$ | Reciprocated relationships
transitive triplets | $s_{i3}(x) = \sum_{j,h} x_{ij}x_{jh}x_{ih}$ | Your friend becomes my friend

Covariate Effect | Sufficient Statistic | Interpretation
-----------------|----------------------|-----------------
covariate-alter  | $s_{i4}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij}z_j$ | Effect of my friend's behavior on friendship
covariate-ego    | $s_{i5}(x) = z_i\sum_j x_{ij}$ | Effect of my behavior on friendship
same covariate   | $s_{i6}(x) = \sum_j x_{ij} \mathbb{I}(z_i = z_j)$ | Birds of a feather flock together

## Fitted SAOMs Example

Inspired by Steglich et al. 2010:

Network Evolution:

- Rate 1 ($\alpha_1$)
- Rate 2 ($\alpha_2$)
- Outdegree ($S_{1} = \sum\limits_{m=1}^2 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{j \neq i} x(t_m)_{ij}$)

Behavior Evolution

## Static Visualizations

- Collections of models & corresponding parameter estimates
- "Heatmap" of probabilities

## Animation

- Microstep Process

## Interactivity with `plotly`

- `geomnet` + `ggplotly()`

## Future Work

- Shiny app for more interactivity
- Simulation studies with more visualization
