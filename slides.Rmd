## Outline

- Motivation
- Working Example
- Model
- Visualizations
    * Static
    * Animation
    * Interactivity with `plotly`

## Motivating Example

Childhood vaccination - major public health concern

- [Vaccination animation](https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated)

<img src="img/guardian.png" alt="Screenshot of animation from The Guardian" style="width:600px;">

## Questions

Random interactions in animation aren't realistic

- How do communities affect vaccination rate?
- How do communities affect spread of disease from outside source? 
- What factors lead to unvaccinated children?
- Can communities be identified and targeted for immunization programs?

> Can network modeling answer these? 

## Working Example

Another public health concern - underage drinking & smoking

> How do friendships influence drinking and smoking behavior in teenagers?

Steglich, Snijders & Pearson (2010) "Dynamic Networks and Behavior: Searating Selection from Influence"

## Data

From "Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study" (Pearson & Mitchell (2000); Pearson & West (2003))

- Glasgow, Scotland, UK
- Panel data - three waves
- Each student lists up to 6 school friends
- Smoking & drinking behavior, other lifestyle variables collected
