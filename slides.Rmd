## Outline

- Motivation
- Working Example
- Model
- Visualizations
    * Static
    * Animation
    * Interactivity with `plotly`

## Motivating Example

Childhood vaccination - major public health concern

- [Vaccination animation](https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated)

<img src="img/guardian.png" alt="Screenshot of animation from The Guardian" style="width:600px;">

## Questions

Random interactions in animation aren't realistic

- How do communities affect vaccination rate?
- How do communities affect spread of disease from outside source? 
- What factors lead to unvaccinated children?
- Can communities be identified and targeted for immunization programs?

> Can network modeling answer these? 

## Working Example

Another public health concern - underage drinking & smoking

> How do friendships influence drinking and smoking behavior in teenagers?

Steglich, Snijders & Pearson (2010) "Dynamic Networks and Behavior: Searating Selection from Influence"

## Data

From "Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study" (Pearson & Mitchell (2000); Pearson & West (2003))

- Glasgow, Scotland, UK, Feb 1995 - Jan 1997
- Panel data - three waves - aged 12-13 to 14-15
- Each student lists up to 6 school friends
- Smoking & drinking behavior, other lifestyle variables collected
- 160 students in total, only 50 in [example data](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/)

## Model

- Want: to determine how friendships change risky behavior and vice versa over time
- Solution: stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) for networks (Snijders 1996)
    * Stochastic because they model network change over time
    * Actor-oriented because actor-level covariates are incorporated into model parameters
    
## Underlying Mechanisms?

Network changes

- Change doesn't happen all at once, but network observations are discrete
- Changes are dependent, with a highly complex structure
- How to model process? 
    * Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs)
    * Condition on wave 1
    * Choose one actor (call it $i$) to (potentially) make a change
    * Choose a second actor (call it $j$) to whom actor $i$ changes ties with probability $p_{ij}$
    
    
    
## Rate Function


## Objective Function

## (Some) Possible Model Parameters 

## Static Visualizations

- Collections of models & corresponding parameter estimates
- "Heatmap" of probabilities

## Animation

- Microstep Process

## Interactivity with `plotly`

- `geomnet` + `ggplotly()`

## Future Work

- Shiny app for more interactivity
- Simulation studies with more visualization
